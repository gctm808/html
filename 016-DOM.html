<!--Learning about the DOM. Use this small code, inspect it using Chrome,
    and see how it is just like a javascript object. Try going into the console,
	and typing document.body.style.backgroundColor = "navy". It has the same 
	notation as a JS object, and adds CSS to the body element. Note that 
	client-side JS will not affect the source code, and any changes made in the
	console will not be saved. -->
