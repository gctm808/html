Repo is for learning HTML basics.
Some very light CSS sprinkled in here and there.
Btw, this is mostly just for learning purposes.
None of this work is considered "portfolio-worthy."
Documentation is almost non-existent, and code overall doesn't look pretty.
Refer to portfolio repo for better examples and nicer code.
